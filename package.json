The smart contracts will first include the creation of two tokens for a trading demonstration on the exchange. They will also connect the order book and the front end, i.e. when a user makes a transaction on the exchange website, the relevant functions in the smart contracts will be called to update the relevant users' balances etc. in the order book.",
